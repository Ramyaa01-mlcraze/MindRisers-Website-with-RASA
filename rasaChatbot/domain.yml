  - text: "Great, carry on!"

  utter_goodbye:
  - text: "Bye"

  utter_iamabot:
  - text: "I am a bot, powered by Rasa."

  utter_about_pep8:
  - text: "PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. PEP 8 is a coding convention, a set of recommendation, about how to write your Python code more readable."

  utter_type_of_python:
  - text: "Python is capable of scripting, but in general sense, it is considered as a general-purpose programming language."

  utter_python_interpreted_language:
  - text: "An interpreted language is any programming language which is not in machine-level code before runtime. Therefore, Python is an interpreted language."

  utter_python_py_pyc_files:
  - text: "The .py files are the python source code files. While the .pyc files contain the bytecode of the python files. .pyc files are created when the code is imported from some other source. The interpreter converts the source .py files to .pyc files which helps by saving time."

  utter_about_python:
  - text: "Python is a programming language with objects, modules, threads, exceptions, and automatic memory management. The benefits of pythons are that it is simple and easy, portable, extensible, build-in data structure, and it is open-source."

  utter_python_pickling_unpickling:
  - text: "Pickle module accepts any Python object and converts it into a string representation and dumps it into a file by using dump function. This process is called pickling. While the process of retrieving original Python objects from the stored string representation is called unpickling."

  utter_python_interpreted:
  - text: "Python language is an interpreted language. Python program runs directly from the source code. It converts the source code that is written by the programmer into an intermediate language, which is again translated into machine language that has to be executed."

  utter_python_fix_bugs:
  - text: "PyChecker is a static analysis tool that detects the bugs in Python source code and warns about the style and complexity of the bug. Pylint is another tool that verifies whether the module meets the coding standard."

  utter_python_decorator:
  - text: "A Python decorator is a specific change that we make in Python syntax to alter functions easily."

  utter_about_python_list_tuple:
  - text: "The difference between list and tuple is that list is mutable while tuple is not. Tuple can be hashed, for example., as a key for dictionaries."

  utter_python_arguments_passed:
  - text: "Everything in Python is an object, and all variables hold references to the objects. The reference values are according to the functions. Therefore, you cannot change the value of the references. However, you can change the objects if it is mutable."

  utter_python_dict_list_comp:
  - text: "They are syntax constructions to ease the creation of a Dictionary or List based on existing iterable."

  utter_python_namespace:
  - text: "In Python, every name introduced has a place where it lives and can be hooked for. This is known as a namespace. It is like a box where a variable name is mapped to the object placed. Whenever the variable is searched out, this box will be searched to get the corresponding object."
